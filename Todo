Possible add item instance. This would contian a uuid, item name

containers should have quantity

Add magic resource

Added character art

Add Defense Level sum to Character Effects

Character Effects and Equipment effects should be represented by the same UI\

Attribute Determined DIce mods are actually Skill governed by attribute mods

Removed percent of movement speed and just use AttributeGovernedSkillMod to reduce the amount of speed

Carry Weight may also need to factor in AttributeGovernedSkillMods, but only once it has all of them from character and equipment, basically carry weight can be effected by other mods, just not the one that it applies to skills. Else that would be recursive hell.

Removed equiped equipment
